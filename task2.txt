Task 2: You are working on a dashboard using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. The dashboard displays data charts which are fetched from a REST API. However, the charts are not updating in real-time as new data arrives from the API.


Question: How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue ensuring the charts update in real-time as the data changes? Explain your approach, potential challenges and the overall thought process

Approach:

1.At First check the url is correct or not.

2.If the url is ok and returing the respose correctly,then check the response format and verify that it includes the latest data.

3.Confirm that the component responsible for rendering the charts is mounting and unmounting correctly.Use console.log statements in lifecycle methods (e.g useEffect hook).

4.Check the data we using in the component is match the api responce format.(e.g. variable name).

5.Ensure that the component's state is being updated with the new data from the API.

6.Verify that the state change triggers a re-render of the component.

7.If the API supports real-time updates, consider using WebSocket or any real-time communication protocol to receive updates instantly.

8.Implement a WebSocket connection or subscribe to a real-time endpoint for live updates.

Challenges:

1.Data Format Changes: Ensure that any changes in the data format returned by the API are handled appropriately in the client-side code.

2.Subscription Handling: If using real-time subscriptions, handle the subscription management and cleanup to avoid memory leaks.

3.Performance Considerations: Real-time updates may have performance implications. Optimize your code to handle frequent updates efficiently.

Overall Thought Process:

1.Verify Data Flow: Confirm that the data from the API is making its way to the component state.

2.Check React Component: Ensure the React component is correctly updating when the state changes.

3.Explore Real-Time Options: Consider real-time options like WebSocket for instant updates.

4.Handle Potential Issues: Address any potential issues such as data format changes or performance concerns.
